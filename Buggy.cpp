/*Steps To identify the issue : 
1- Run the strace -c ./Buggy :There is an error at  openat 
2- Run the strace ./Buggy There is an error at return of system call openat which return -1 No such file or directory 
3- Sample.txt is not exist 
Solution 
1- Use #include<fcntl.h> defines constants used with system calls like open, fcntl, and creat for specifying file access modes and flags.
2- Use open()   with flag O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC: Open the file for writing, create it if it doesnâ€™t exist, and truncate it to zero length if it does.
3- Use open() with access modes _IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO: File permission flags for:
S_IRWXU: Read, write, execute for the owner.
S_IRWXG: Read, write, execute for the group.
S_IRWXO: Read, write, execute for others.

Result : 
1-The normal compilation of the file without compilation error. 
2-The program executed in normal way without error "Error: File not found!"
3-Execute the strace-c ./Buggy there is no errors at openAt and also no permission erros.
4- Execute the strace ./Buggy there is no errors at file execution
